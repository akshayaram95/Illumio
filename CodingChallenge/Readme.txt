Illumio Coding AssignmentApproach:The submitted code is not a complete solution for the given problem.I have tried to implement a HashSet of the Entry class type for storing the data in the file.The reason for choosing a hashset is, it would provide a faster access to the records in the data. We can check if a record is present or not in a set in O(1) time.For implementing a HashSet, I have implemented my own hashcode and equals function for the same. The problem with the submitted code is an improper definition of the hashcode. Hence when we call the contains() method, it is not able to access the same.A better method for improving the solution, is by using bit manipulation operation, which would make the process more efficient and would be easier to generate a hash value. Due to time constraint was not able to do the same.Steps for executing the code:This is a readme file containing instructions for executing Firewall.Steps for running the files from cmdNOTE: while executing from command prompt, the pwd should be the directory containing1.
